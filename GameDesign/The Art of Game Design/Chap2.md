## Game design goals
- Game designer cares about the user experience (the booke even say that the game is just a means to an end)
- The game is not the experience. This means that, without the player It doens't make sense design a game (Remember the three falling fable)
- As a designer we are not caring about how the three fell, we only care about the experience of hearing it fell
- The three is just a mean to an end
- "if we could, through some high-tech magic, create experiences for people directly, with no underlying media — no game boards, no computers, no screens — we would do it"
- Psychology, Antropology, design
	-  The first focus on understanding how the people think
	- the second focus on uderstand people on human level (physical, mental, cultural aspects)
	- The third focus on people happines/feeling
- A good game designer mix these three fields of knowledge

## Introspection
- Act to analyze your own thoughts
- There are two perils in introspection
	-  False conclusion (just because something feels true, It doesn't mean that is true)
	- Think that what you like other people like (However don't believe only in play test, they can be also wrong)
-  However we need the introspection to create our hypothesis, because we need to start from something

## Dissect your feelings
- Introspection is a good tool if used with balance
- However It's hard to know your own feelings about something
- In order to express better to ourselves we need to dissect our feelings into words (feelings are abstract, words are concrete)
- More you analyze how a game makes you feel more you will better to express yourself #Task

## Defeating Heisenberg
- "How can we observe our own experiences without tainting them?"
- "the nature of an experience cannot be observed without disturbing the nature of that experience. This makes introspection sound hopeless"
